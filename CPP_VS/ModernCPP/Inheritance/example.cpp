 * The main function is the entry point of every C++ program. It is where
 * the program starts executing. The function is called by the C++ runtime
 * environment without any parameters.
 *
 * The function simply prints "Hello World" to the console using the C++
 * standard output stream object cout and the endl manipulator to insert a
 * newline character at the end of the string.
 *
 * The function returns an integer as the program's exit code. In this case
 * the exit code is 0 which indicates that the program executed successfully.
